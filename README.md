There are 5 questions. 
the first one required me to take two variables, add them, multiply the result by 3 and square the final result. 

Question two needed me to generate a password based on given information.

The third asked me to identify even and odd numbers and print something specific depending on if the numbers were odd or even. 

The fourth was  a program that adds the integers before the given number as a total. (minus the given number.)

The fifth was a game where you had to input numbers until your number matched that of a random one chosen by the program. The program would display instructions on what to do if you guessed the wrong one. The game has two palyers.
